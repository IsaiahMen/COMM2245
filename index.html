<h2>About me</h2>

My name is Isaiah Mendoza, I'm a sophomore in the business program with a concentration in Marketing Management and also taking other classes for Physical Therapy. My career goals are to graduate from UNM and start working as a full time physical therapist and along the road hopefully open up my own clinic. I'm simply taking this class because it's a requirement to take a communions class and because this class to me sounds very interesting and something that I can learn and use down the road. Other information about myself is that I love going to the gym and mountain biking on my free time, I also love to learn new things and stepping outside of my comfort zone for example I am teaching myself how to do card tricks. Below is a picture of one of my many happy places.
